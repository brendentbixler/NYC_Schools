## Description
Coding challenge for the nyc schools api:
Makes an initial api call to display a list of schools in nyc in a recycler view.
Then make a secondary api call to display the sat scores for a selected school.

## Usage
Run the app and enjoy! scroll through the list of schools and select one you wnat to see
the SAT scores for.

## Roadmap
A couple features I want to add in the future that I didn't have time for:
[] Change sat scores (SchoolInfo) to a fragment that will display the sat data
[] Sort the schools before listing them
[] Once sorted, add headers for each new beginning letter like a contact list
